This face detection process actually verifies the image is face image or not. Detection process actually works on MTCNN algorithm. Object Detection using MTCNN algorithm- is a python(pip) library. It is machine learning based approach used to extract faces and features from pictures or videos.
MTCNN is a way to integrate both tasks (recognition and alignment) using multi-task learning. In the first stage it uses a shallow CNN to quickly produce candidate
windows. In the second stage, it refines the proposed candidate windows through a more complex CNN and lastly, in the third stage, it uses third CNN more complex
than the others, to further refine the result and output facial landmark positions.
